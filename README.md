# Metro simulation

This repository is an attempt to make simple metro simulation in pygame.

This simulation will involve multiple tracks; trains; signals and sensors at intersections to prevent crashes. The final aim is to make it completely automated with good crash control. Further aim is to control these train and sensors with help of external devices.

This project will help me learn pygame and data structures in python in general.
Hope this turns out to be fun!
